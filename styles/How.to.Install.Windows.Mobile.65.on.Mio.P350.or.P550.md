1. Download the ROM file from this link[^3^]. This is a custom ROM created by CrashOverHead, a developer who ported Windows Mobile 6.5 to these devices. The ROM file is in Italian, but you can change the language later.
2. Extract the ROM file to your computer using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder called "MioP350\_P550\_WM65\_1\_5b\_CrashOverHead". Inside this folder, there are two subfolders: "MioP350" and "MioP550". Choose the one that matches your device model.
3. Connect your Mio device to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure the device is turned on and has enough battery power.
4. Run the file called "ROMUpdateUtility.exe" from the subfolder that you chose in step 2. This will launch a program that will flash the ROM to your device.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the process to complete. Do not disconnect or turn off your device during this process.
6. When the process is done, your device will reboot automatically. You should see a new boot screen with the Windows Mobile 6.5 logo.
7. After the reboot, you will have to go through the initial setup wizard, where you can choose your language, time zone, and other settings.
8. Congratulations! You have successfully installed Windows Mobile 6.5 on your Mio P350 or P550 device. Enjoy!
